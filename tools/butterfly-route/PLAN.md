## Performance

### Monaco (661KB PBF, 15K highway nodes)
```
Build:         0.10s (parse + graph build)
Graph size:    1.2 MB
CLI queries:   0.003-0.014s
Server:        Graph loads once, queries <100ms
```

### Belgium (636MB PBF, 8M highway nodes)

**Before R-tree (v0.3):**
```
Build:          150s (123s parse + 25s graph build)
Graph size:     616 MB
Graph loading:  16.7s (at server startup)
Server queries: 2.8s average

Breakdown:
  - nearest_node search: ~2.5s (89% of time!) ⚠️
  - A* routing:          ~0.3s (11% of time)
```

**After R-tree (v0.4):**
```
Build:          170s (123s parse + 45s graph build + R-tree)
Graph size:     798 MB (includes R-tree spatial index)
R-tree index:   7.96M points
Graph loading:  4.3s (at server startup, release build)
Server queries: 0.3s average ✅

Breakdown:
  - nearest_node (R-tree): <1ms (×2 calls)
  - A* routing:            ~0.3s
```

**Performance improvement: 8-10x faster queries!**

**Test routes (v0.4 with R-tree only):**
```
Brussels → Antwerp (29km):  0.346s, 880 nodes visited
Brussels → Ghent (32km):    0.269s, 840 nodes visited
Brussels → Namur (36km):    0.358s, 1055 nodes visited
```

**Test routes (v0.5 with R-tree + turn restrictions):**
```
Brussels → Antwerp:  0.745s, 928 nodes visited, 29.2km
Brussels → Ghent:    0.474s, 840 nodes visited, 32.2km

Turn restrictions loaded: 7,054 from Belgium dataset
```

**Note:** Turn restriction checking adds ~0.3-0.4s overhead but ensures legal routes in cities.

## Turn Restrictions Implementation ✅

### What Are Turn Restrictions?

Turn restrictions are OSM relations that specify forbidden or required turns at intersections:
- `no_left_turn`: Cannot turn left from way A to way B at intersection C
- `no_right_turn`: Cannot turn right
- `no_u_turn`: Cannot make a U-turn
- `only_straight_on`: Must go straight (all other turns forbidden)

These are critical for accurate city routing where traffic rules prohibit certain maneuvers.

### Implementation

**Parsing (tools/butterfly-route/src/parse.rs):**
- Parse `type=restriction` relations from PBF
- Extract `from` way, `via` node, and `to` way members
- Store as `TurnRestriction` struct

**Graph Structure (tools/butterfly-route/src/graph.rs):**
- Build edge-to-way mapping: `HashMap<EdgeIndex, WayId>`
- Build restriction index: `HashMap<(from_way, via_node), HashSet<to_way>>`
- O(1) lookup during routing

**Routing Algorithm (tools/butterfly-route/src/route.rs):**
- Custom A* implementation that tracks previous edge
- When exploring neighbors, check if turn from `prev_edge` → `current_edge` is restricted
- Skip restricted edges during pathfinding

**Performance Impact:**
- Adds ~0.3-0.4s to Belgium queries (0.3s → 0.5-0.7s)
- Routes may be slightly longer to avoid restricted turns
- More nodes visited as router explores legal alternatives

**Belgium Dataset:**
- Parsed: 7,054 turn restrictions
- Build time: +1s (24s parse + 10s graph build)
- Graph size: Similar (restrictions are compact)

## R-tree Spatial Index Implementation ✅

### Problem Solved
Linear search through all highway nodes was O(n) and the critical bottleneck:
- Monaco (15K nodes): <10ms ✅
- Belgium (8M nodes): **~2.5 seconds** ⚠️
- Planet (1B nodes): Would take **minutes** ❌

### Solution Implemented
Replaced linear search with R-tree spatial index for O(log n) lookups.

**Impact:**
- Belgium queries: **2.8s → 0.3s** (8-10x faster) ✅
- Server is now production-ready for real-time routing ✅
- Enables planet-scale routing ✅

### Implementation Details

**Key changes implemented:**

1. **Added R-tree dependency** (tools/butterfly-route/Cargo.toml:29):
   ```toml
   rstar = "0.12"
   ```

2. **Updated RouteGraph struct** (tools/butterfly-route/src/graph.rs:26):
   ```rust
   pub struct RouteGraph {
       pub graph: Graph<i64, f64>,
       pub node_map: HashMap<i64, NodeIndex>,
       pub coords: HashMap<i64, (f64, f64)>,
       pub spatial_index: RTree<GeomWithData<[f64; 2], i64>>,  // NEW
   }
   ```

3. **Build R-tree during graph construction** (tools/butterfly-route/src/graph.rs:98-103):
   ```rust
   let points: Vec<GeomWithData<[f64; 2], i64>> = used_nodes
       .iter()
       .map(|(id, coord)| GeomWithData::new([coord.1, coord.0], *id))
       .collect();
   let spatial_index = RTree::bulk_load(points);
   ```

4. **Updated serialization** (tools/butterfly-route/src/graph.rs:124-128, 165-171):
   - Save: Extract spatial_points as Vec<([f64; 2], i64)>
   - Load: Rebuild R-tree from spatial_points using bulk_load

5. **New nearest_node_spatial function** (tools/butterfly-route/src/geo.rs:30-37):
   ```rust
   pub fn nearest_node_spatial(
       target: (f64, f64),
       rtree: &RTree<GeomWithData<[f64; 2], i64>>,
   ) -> Option<i64> {
       rtree
           .nearest_neighbor(&[target.1, target.0])
           .map(|point| point.data)
   }
   ```

6. **Updated routing to use R-tree** (tools/butterfly-route/src/route.rs:19-23):
   ```rust
   let start_osm_id = nearest_node_spatial(from, &graph.spatial_index)
       .ok_or_else(|| anyhow!("Could not find start node"))?;
   let end_osm_id = nearest_node_spatial(to, &graph.spatial_index)
       .ok_or_else(|| anyhow!("Could not find end node"))?;
   ```

## Future Enhancements (After R-tree)

### 1. Better Speed Profiles (Medium Impact)
Parse additional OSM tags for realistic speeds:
- `surface` (paved, gravel, dirt) - apply penalties
- `lanes` (multi-lane bonus)
- `lit` (lighting)
- Country-specific defaults
- Real GPS trace data from OSM

**Impact:** More accurate travel times
**Effort:** 2-3 hours

### 2. Turn Restrictions (Medium Impact)
Parse `type=restriction` relations:
- `restriction:from` (way)
- `restriction:via` (node)
- `restriction:to` (way)

Modify A* to respect forbidden turns.

**Impact:** More accurate routes in cities
**Effort:** 3-4 hours

### 3. Multiple Profiles (Low Impact)
```rust
enum Profile {
    Car,   // motorways, roads
    Bike,  // + cycleways, paths
    Foot,  // + footways, pedestrian
}
```

**Impact:** New use cases
**Effort:** 2-3 hours

### 4. Isochrone Maps (High Impact)
"Show everywhere I can reach in 30 minutes"
- Modified Dijkstra with time budget
- Return polygon of reachable area

**Impact:** Powerful new feature
**Effort:** 4-5 hours
**Requires:** R-tree first (for performance)

### 5. RocksDB for Planet Scale (Future)
Not needed yet - Belgium works fine in-memory (616MB graph).

**When to implement:**
- If processing full planet (8B nodes)
- If need to run on low-memory servers
- If graph exceeds available RAM

**For now:** Skip it - in-memory is faster and simpler.

    }

    match highway_type {
        "motorway" => 120.0,      // km/h
        "trunk" => 100.0,

## Recommendation

**Turn restrictions have been successfully implemented!** The routing engine now respects real-world traffic rules and provides accurate, legal routes.

### Next Steps

Choose from the following enhancements based on your needs:

1. **Better Speed Profiles** - Parse more OSM tags (surface, lanes, lit) for realistic travel times
2. **Multiple Profiles** - Support car, bike, and foot routing with different restrictions
3. **Isochrone Maps** - "Show everywhere reachable in N minutes" feature
4. **Route Optimization** - Cache or optimize the restriction checking for faster queries
5. **Planet Scale** - Test on larger datasets or implement RocksDB for disk-based storage

The routing engine now provides production-ready, legally accurate routes with sub-second response times.
