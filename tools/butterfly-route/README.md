# butterfly-shrink ðŸ¦‹

`butterfly-shrink` is a high-performance, memory-efficient tool within the `butterfly-osm` ecosystem designed to optimize OpenStreetMap (OSM) PBF files for routing applications. It strips non-routing data and collapses nodes to a configurable grid resolution, maintaining compatibility with standard routing engines.

## Development Status

**Current Phase**: Planning and Design. Detailed specifications are available in `PLAN.md`.
